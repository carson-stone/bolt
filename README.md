# bolt
Bolt is a social media app project I made to learn mobile development. Bolt is an app that lets users upload images, follow friends, and upload reaction images to other users' content. 

## tech
The app was developed with Dart/Flutter, and the backend was made with node + express.js. It also uses a Mongo.db database.
